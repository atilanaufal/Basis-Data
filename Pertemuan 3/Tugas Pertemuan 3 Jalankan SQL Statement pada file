1. Buat DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE Product

2. Buat Tabel customer dan product
CREATE TABLE Product(
ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
ProductName VARCHAR(100),
SupplierID INT,
CategoryID INT,
Unit VARCHAR(50),
Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE Customers(
customerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
customerName VARCHAR(100),
contactName VARCHAR(100),
address VARCHAR(255),
city VARCHAR(100),
postalCode VARCHAR(20),
country VARCHAR(100)
);

3. Import Data dari excel ke masing-masing tabel
Gunakan fitur Tabel Data Import Wizard. Sebelum mengimport data, dile excel dipisah menjadi dua file dengan format csv

4. Lihat seluruh data pada kedua tabel
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Product;

5. Mempraktekan syntax WHERE
SELECT *  FROM Customers
ORDER BY customerID;

SELECT *  FROM Customers
WHERE country = "Mexico";

SELECT *  FROM Customers

SELECT *  FROM Product
WHERE price >= 30;

SELECT *  FROM Product
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 60;

SELECT MAX(price) AS LargestPrice FROM Product; 

SELECT City FROM Customer
UNION
SELECT City From Supplier
ORDER BY City;

SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

SELECT ALL ProductName FROM Products WHERE TRUE;

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price > SOME (SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE Price > 20);

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE EXISTS (SELECT Price XISTS FROM Products WHERE Price > 50);

SELECT *, rowid FROM Employee WHERE rowid = 2;

6. Mempraktekan Syntax ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM Product
ORDER BY Price ASC;

SELECT * FROM Product
ORDER BY ProductName DESC;

SELECT * FROM Customers 
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

7. Mempraktekan Syntax Limit
SELECT id pesanan, tanggal pesan 
FROM pesanan LIMIT 10;

8. Mempraktekan Syntax GROUP BY
SELECT kóta, COUNT(*) AS Jumlah_pelanggan

SELECT CustomerName, City, Country FROM Customers;
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS "Contact Person" FROM Customers;
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer FROM Customers;

9. Mempraktekan  Syntax INNER JOIN & SELF JOIN
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

SELECT O.OrderID, C.CustomerName, O.OrderDate FROM Orders O
INNER JOIN Customers C ON O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID;

10. Mempraktekan Syntax DISTINCT & CASE
SELECT DISTINCT kota FROM pelanggan;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;


SELECT OrderID, Quantity, CASE
WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30"
ELSE 'The quantity is under 30' 
END AS QuantityText FROM OrderDetails;

11. Mempraktekkan Syntax DML
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country) SELECT SúpplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
